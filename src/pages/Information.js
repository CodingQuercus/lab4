                <p>Latitude64 manifactures discs in our own
                    factory in the north of Sweden. Our discs
                    are designed by PDGA Hall of Fame member
                    Tomas Ekström in co-operation with local
                    European Champions
                    <br /><br /><strong>Opto Air</strong> uses the same
                    material as our durable Opto Line plastic.
                    It is modified and the runs are done in a
                    different way to achieve a stunning result
                    of lighter weight discs that still has a
                    layer of solid plastic at the tip and
                    bottom of the rim to protect the alternated
                    material that is mostly centered in the middle
                    of the rim but also spread out slightly over
                    the top of the discs to keep the weight
                    distribution as close as possible to the
                    Opto and Gold Line discs.
                    <br /><br /><strong>Gold Line</strong> is
                    our premium blend plastic. The start of
                    the mix has been the same brand plastics
                    used in Opto Line but we added a different
                    polymer to give it better grip without
                    losing the excellent durability of Opto Line.
                    <br /><br /><strong>Opto line</strong> is made out
                    of some of the world’s most durable plastics.
                    It comes in a variety of beautiful transluscent
                    colors. The Opto Line plastic has been developed
                    to withstand severe punishment and extreme conditions
                    better than other plastics. Grip Line has been developed
                    to produce discs with the best grip on the
                    market. It has a ”shiny” look that makes the
                    bright colors stand out. Discs in the Grip
                    plastic are no longer in production, but may
                    still be available for purchase at retailers
                    and stores until it’s out of stock.
                    <br /><br /><strong>Zero Line</strong> is the soft grippy putter
                    plastic used in our putters and approach
                    discs. The plastic is chosen because of
                    the good grip and feel. The feel you need
                    in your short game! We have received much
                    demand for softer Zero Line discs, so we
                    will make an effort to deliver that during 2013.
                    <br /><br /><strong>Eze Line</strong> was used during 2012 and the plan
                    was that it would replace Zero Line. We have
                    not been satisfied with the outcome of some
                    of the discs so production in Eze Line material
                    will be put on hold. During 2013 the premium
                    putter plastic used in Zero Line will be back
                    on the shelves.
                    <br /><br /><strong>Retro Line:</strong> The mid 80s
                    was a great time. Disc Golf had just come all
                    the way up to Latitude 64 and we played all
                    through the night in the midnight sun.
                    Translucent discs were far from being invented
                    and all discs were understable with today's
                    standards. We remember those days with nostalgic
                    feelings and wanted a plastic that would remind
                    us of how it used to be. For a long time we have
                    had requests that we should make discs that
                    could be broken in more easily. Test after
                    test after test led us to this new plastic blend
                    that we have named Retro.

                    player may feel the BT plastic easier to grip
                    than our other plastics. The BT plastic is more
                    economical compared to high-end VIP and
                    Tournament plastics but BT plastics durability
                    is not as good. The BT plastic is available at

                    <br /><br /><strong>VIP-plastic:</strong>
                    VIP plastic is our most durable plastic. t comes in
                    a nice see through and opaque appearance. It has a
                    tacky grip nice glossy finish. Designed with super
                    resistant polymers to withstand great force, still

                    characteristics. No matter what you hit VIP will
                    show great resilience and fly the same the next

                    <br /><br /><strong>Tournament-plastic:</strong>
                    Our Tournament plastic is just what it sounds like.
                    Designed with the experienced tournament player in mind,
                    TP has a tackier grip, and is faster out if the hand.
                    It has a softer feel, thus breaking in easier than VIP.
                    Not all shots are hyzers and sometimes you will have to
                    shape shots. TP plastic will give you the flights you
                    need in those tournament situations.

                    <br /><br /><strong>VIP AIR-plastic:</strong>

                    for players of all levels. It will give you more distance
                    in most conditions. VIP air has the same feel in the hand
                    as our VIP line but is just lighter and infused with tiny
                    air bubbles. The bubbles help the disc stay in the air longer.

                <p>
                    Dynamic Discs started in March of 2005 as an internet
                    and eBay based online disc golf store specializing in
                    custom discs and apparel. In December of 2012, Dynamic
                    Discs transitioned from disc golf retailer to disc golf
                    retailer and disc golf manufacturer by partnering with
                    Latitude 64° to have golf discs designed and produced
                    to serve the growing demands of the disc golf industry.

                    <br /><br /><strong>Moonshine:</strong> Moonshine has
                    all oft he benefits of Lucid with an added feature -
                    it glows in the dark! Give your disc some light and
                    keep golfing all night long. Expect Moonshine molds
                    to be slightly more overstable than the Lucid version.

                    <br /><br /><strong>Fuzion:</strong> Fuzion combines the
                    durability of Lucid with an advanced polymer to provide
                    players with additional grip. It is a non-transparent
                    blend of plastic that is slightly more overstable
                    than the Lucid version.

                    <br /><br /><strong>Lucid:</strong> The perfect combination
                    of polymers produce some of the most beautiful and
                    durable plastic in disc golf. This translucent blend
                    can take a beating and maintain the original flight
                    characteristics of the disc for many rounds of disc golf.

                    <br /><br /><strong>Lucid Air:</strong>Lucid Air uses the same
                    material as our durable Lucid plastic. It has solid and
                    bottom of the rim to protect the microbubbles in the
                    plastic on impact. These plastic at the topmicrobubbles
                    actually make the disc lighter. They are spread out
                    through the top of the disc and middle of the rim to
                    keep the weight distribution nearly identical to Lucid
                    and Fuzion discs.

                    <br /><br /><strong>BioFuzion:</strong> BioFuzion plastic is
                    the by-product from a mixture of Lucid and Fuzion plastics
                    that had blemishesor cosmetic flaws. Some of these discs
                    may have specks of plastic, flakes , or other minor cosmetic
                    flaws that will not affect the flight, performance, or
                    durability of the disc.

                    <br /><br /><strong>Classic Soft:</strong> When feel and grip are
                    the most important elements, reach for Classic Soft. This
                    blend of plastic gives the disc that perfect feel and
                    fit in your hand.

                    <br /><br /><strong>Classic Blend:</strong> Classic Blend is
                    the perfect combination of grip and flexibility in the
                    Classic plastic series. If Classic Soft is too soft
                    and Classic is too hard, reach for the blend!

                    <br /><br /><strong>Classic:</strong>
                    Classic plastic is the perfect blend of
                    tackiness and firmness for players looking
                    for a stiff golf disc.
